This is the dataset which contain the player list based on the IPL auction 2022 where we had performed data analysis based on the data-set we had.

tools used:
1.Pandas

Removing NAn values and renaming the Nan value with 0 and other such as piechart bargrpah diagram we had constructed.

  Yes, you can replace the NaN values in a column with 0 (or any other placeholder) while preserving other data in the column. This can be done using the fillna() method in pandas. Because some columns data are needed as some contains useful values otherwise of that columns had not any value remove it by using drop() functions.


This code creates a bar plot to visualize the distribution of players across different teams based on their types, such as batsman, bowler, etc. The figure size is set to (16, 8) to ensure the graph is large enough for clear visualization, especially when dealing with many teams or player categories. The sns.countplot function generates the bar chart. It filters out players whose team is labeled as 'Unsold' and plots the count of players for each remaining team on the X-axis. The hue parameter groups the bars by the player type (TYPE), so each bar cluster represents a team, and each color within a cluster corresponds to a specific player type. The Set2 color palette is applied to make the visualization more visually appealing.

The plot is then customized with a title, labeled X and Y axes, and rotated X-axis labels at a 50-degree angle to avoid overlap and improve readability, particularly for longer team names. The plt.tight_layout() function ensures that all elements of the graph fit neatly within the figure area without overlapping. Finally, a legend is added to the top right corner of the plot, explaining the colors representing different player types. This makes the graph easy to interpret and provides a clear overview of the player distribution by team and type.
